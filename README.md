The Capstone from Riley Gibson for General Assembly :

I am creating a personal online art store. I have wanted to do this for some time, I make small black and white doodles comprised of erratic lines and shapes. 
The website will display this art and allow for real transactions. To give myself more of a challenge, I want it to be auction format. Users will sign up,
and outbid each other for desired items. An admin page for myself will allow posting new art for auction. 

Technologies:

stripe. +
MERN 
possible implementation of redux.
